# Task Manager Project

## Authors:

## Program Description:   
This program serves as a basic task manager where you can add, edit, and delete tasks. The tasks also have statuses where you can mark tasks as "Not started", "In progress", or "Completed". This project served as practice for front-end development (HMTL, CSS, Javascript) as I was a bit rustyüòÜ. 

In the future, I can improve it by adding dates and calendar functionality. I can also use a database (like MySQL or MongoDB - good learning opportunity) instead of json.
